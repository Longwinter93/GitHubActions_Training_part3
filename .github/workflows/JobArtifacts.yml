#This job creates a job artifact
#To store locally files that are produced by a build job, we need to add this step action - upload artifacts:
#We add a name to artifact - dist-files,a path describes where to find files that should be stored.
#We store this file in a dist folder

#After running a build job, it will produce files.
#We can take a look at these files locally by running commands on the terminal:
#npm install
#npm run build
#It produces a dist folder.It is the artifact produced by a build job in GitHub Action.
#This folder should be uploaded to some web server
#It is the output of this build step (a build job)
#If we run this workflow on GitHub Actions - these files are produced on the runner machine
#If the workflow is finished, the runner machine will be shutdown - these files will be lost
#Therefore, we want to store these files locally after the runner machine will be shut down
