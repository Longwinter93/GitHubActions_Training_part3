#This job creates a job artifact - some files
#To store locally files (artifacts) that are produced by a build job, we need to add this step action - upload artifacts.
#We add a name to artifact - dist-files, a path describes where to find files (artifacts) that should be stored to upload.
#Thanks to this step, We store these files(artifacts) dist & package.json in a dist folder that were found
#They are located in a workflow. We can download it (access manually)

#After running a build job, it will produce files.
#We can take a look at these files locally by running commands on the terminal:
#npm install
#npm run build
#It produces a dist folder.It is the artifact produced by a build job in GitHub Action.
#This folder should be uploaded to some web server
#It is the output of this build step (a build job)
#If we run this workflow on GitHub Actions - these files are produced on the runner machine
#If the workflow is finished, the runner machine will be shutdown - these files will be lost
#Therefore, we want to store these files locally after the runner machine will be shut down
